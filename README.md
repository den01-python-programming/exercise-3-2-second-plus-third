# Exercise 3.2 Second plus third

Write a program that asks the user for strings and adds them to a list. The program stops reading when the user enters 0. The program then prints the first value on the list.

Modify the program so that instead of the first value, the program prints the sum of the second and third numbers. The program is allowed to malfunction if there are fewer than three entries on the list, so you don't need to prepare for such an event at all.
